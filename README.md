# minicomics

I've been making these comics from a sheet of A4 paper that 
folds down to a micro-zine.

The aim of the project is to present these in a digital format while preserving the ability to print them and fold them into the original format.

## priorities

### print first

This started as an experiment in CSS grid and `@print` media query.

I wanted to be able to distribue the minicomics to friends easily while retaining the physical format which is an important aspect of the comics. 

### mobile second

I lost track of this in the initial rush of early styling, but in terms of target device, if the comics are not printed then the second choice for consuming them is in a mobile format which is comparable in terms of size and interaction.
